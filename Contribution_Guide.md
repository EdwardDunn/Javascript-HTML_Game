**Tips** 

- If you're working on an open issue then place a comment on it so that others know it's in progress
     
- Use the issue description you are working on for your commit message e.g. "Issue #10 Updated README.md"

- If you're not working on one of the existing issues, remember to create a new one before you submit a Pull Request

- If another contributor has commented on an issue this usually means they are working on it, have a look at the comments.

- Before you create a new pull request, test your changes to ensure they work correctly. Try playing the game a few times in different 
  browsers.
